# Analyzing-Marketing-Campaigns-with-pandas

This is interactive course from datacamp that i practiced translating common business questions into measurable outcomes, including "How did this campaign perform?", "Which channel is referring the most subscribers?", "Why is a particular channel underperforming?" and more using a fake marketing dataset based on the data of an online subscription business. This course will build on Python and pandas fundamentals, such as merging/slicing datasets, groupby(), correcting data types and visualizing results using matplotlib.
